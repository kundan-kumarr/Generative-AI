## 📘 What You’ll Learn

Over the next 100 days, you'll journey through:

- Core Machine Learning & NLP Techniques
- LLMs like GPT, LLaMA, and custom models via HuggingFace
- Prompt Engineering and Chatbot Design
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Multimodal AI (Image, Video, Audio with LLMs)
- Agentic AI with CrewAI, LangChain, Haystack, LlamaIndex, and more
- CI/CD Pipelines and Production-Ready AI Deployment
